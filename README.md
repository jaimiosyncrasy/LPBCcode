# LPBCcode
------------------------
Repo for saving LPBC code
Driver_v2 is the "main" file that calls the other functions, PlotLocalControl is ran after driver_v2 finishes running
Sim_v2 is the simulink portion of the code, it is built using a GUI and internally matlab converts it to code, so the code is what you see here, not very readable at all
